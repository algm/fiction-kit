## Principles Check

*GATE: Must pass before proceeding to scene breakdown. Re-check after major changes.*

- [ ] Structure serves the story's emotional journey
- [ ] Each act has clear goals and turning points
- [ ] Protagonist's arc is tracked through all acts
- [ ] Subplots support rather than distract from main plot
- [ ] Pacing allows for both tension and breathing room
- [ ] Theme is woven throughout without being heavy-handed
