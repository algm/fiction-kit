# [PROJECT NAME] Fiction Writing Guidelines

Auto-generated from story outline. Last updated: [DATE]

## Essential References

**Before ANY prose generation:**
1. Read `/memory/principles.md` for language, style, voice (MANDATORY - ABORT if language undefined)
2. Check `navigation-guide.md` to locate information (never guess locations)

**Key files:**
- `/memory/principles.md` - Writing rules, language, style
- `navigation-guide.md` - Information location map
- `premise.md` - Story concept, theme
- `characters/` - Character profiles  
- `world/` - World-building
- `outline/` - Plot structure
- `scenes/` - Scene breakdowns

## Core Rules

**Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information exists in ONE location. Reference via markdown links, never duplicate.

**Cross-references**: Use `[text](path/file.md)` in planning files. Keep prose clean (no links in narrative).

**Outline restriction**: Most commands cannot modify outline/chapter/scene structure. Only `/fiction.outline` and `/fiction.scenes` can.
