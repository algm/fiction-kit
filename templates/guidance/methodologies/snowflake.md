## Snowflake Method Guidance

The **Snowflake Method** starts simple and expands in progressive layers.

**Core Principle**: Start with a simple idea and build complexity step-by-step, like a snowflake crystal growing.

### For Premise Development

**Step 1: One-Sentence Summary** (15 words or less)
- Format: [PROTAGONIST] must [ACTION] or else [STAKES]
- Include protagonist, goal, and what's at stake
- Make it compelling enough to sell the book
- Use roles, not names yet

**Step 2: One-Paragraph Summary** (5 sentences)
1. Setup: Introduce protagonist and their world
2. Inciting Incident: What disrupts the status quo
3. Complications: Key plot developments
4. Climax: Final confrontation or crisis
5. Resolution: How it all ends

### For Character Development

**Step 3: Character Summaries** (One page each for major characters)
- Name and one-sentence role/arc
- Motivation (abstract goal) and Goal (concrete want)
- Conflict (what stands in their way)
- Epiphany (what they learn/how they change)
- One-paragraph summary of their journey

**Best Practices**:
- Start with protagonist, then antagonist
- Make sure goals conflict with each other
- Character arcs should support theme
- Epiphany drives the ending

### For Outline Development

**Step 4: Expand to One Page**
- Take one-paragraph summary and expand each sentence to a full paragraph
- Results in five-paragraph, one-page story synopsis
- Show causality between events
- Include major plot points and twists
- This becomes your submission synopsis

**Step 6: Expand to Four Pages** (one page per act)
- Page 1 - Act I: Setup through commitment
- Page 2 - Act II-A: Complications through midpoint
- Page 3 - Act II-B: Escalation through All is Lost
- Page 4 - Act III: Resolution through ending

**Step 8: Complete Scene List** (The detailed roadmap)

For each scene include:
- POV character and other characters present
- Setting (where and when)
- Scene goal (what POV character wants)
- Conflict (what stands in their way)
- Disaster (how it goes wrong)
- Reaction (emotional response)
- Dilemma (new problem or choice)
- Decision (what they decide to do next)
- One-paragraph summary

**Scene Types**:
- **Proactive scenes** (action): Character pursues goal → disaster
- **Reactive scenes** (reaction): Character processes → dilemma → decision

**Best Practices for Scenes**:
- Alternate action and reaction scenes
- Each scene 1,000-2,500 words typically
- Every scene must advance plot OR deepen character
- No filler scenes
- End on hooks or questions
- Number scenes for easy reference

### Snowflake Strengths

**Use Snowflake when**:
- You need detailed planning before drafting
- Working on complex plots or multiple POVs
- First-time novelist feeling overwhelmed
- Genre fiction with strict structure needs
- You revise better with a clear plan

### Key Snowflake Principles

1. **Don't skip steps**: Each layer builds on previous
2. **Iterate**: Go back and revise earlier steps as you learn
3. **Be specific**: Vague plans lead to vague drafts
4. **Focus on causality**: "Because of this, therefore that"
5. **Start small**: One sentence forces clarity
6. **Expand naturally**: Each step flows from previous
7. **Stay flexible**: Plan serves the story, not vice versa
8. **Actually write**: Best plan is worthless unwritten

### Integration with Theme

- **Step 1-2**: What's the story about (beyond plot)?
- **Step 3**: Character arcs embody theme
- **Step 4-6**: Thematic questions at each act
- **Step 8**: Each scene touches theme somehow

### Variations

**Front-Loaded**: Complete steps 1-8 before writing anything - detailed roadmap for plotters

**Iterative**: Complete steps 1-4, draft a bit, add steps 5-6, draft more - mix of planning and discovery

**Minimal**: Steps 1-4 and 8 only, skip deep character charts - quick planning for experienced writers
