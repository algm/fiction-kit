## Discovery Writing Guidance (Pantsing)

**Discovery Writing** is an organic approach where you discover the story through the act of writing, rather than planning everything upfront.

**Core Principle**: Trust your creative instincts and let the story unfold naturally. The first draft is exploration.

### Minimum Starting Points

**You need at least 1-2 of these** (not all):
- **Compelling character**: Someone who fascinates you
- **Intriguing situation**: Opening scene or premise
- **Powerful image**: Scene you can't stop thinking about
- **Thematic question**: What you want to explore
- **Emotional journey**: Feeling arc you want to create

**Optional** (nice to have but not required):
- General sense of ending
- 2-3 key turning points
- Character backstory (may change)
- Setting or world basics
- Tone and voice

**What you DON'T need**:
- Complete outline, chapter plan, beat sheet
- Character arc mapped out
- Every plot twist planned
- Detailed world bible

### The Discovery Process

**Phase 1: The Messy First Draft**
- **Write forward, don't look back**
- **Follow instincts** scene by scene
- **Let "mistakes" happen** (they may be gifts)
- **Don't fix continuity yet**
- **Keep momentum** - finish the draft
- **Allow yourself to "write badly"**

**When stuck**:
- Ask: "What would make this worse for the protagonist?"
- Jump to a scene you're excited about
- Interview your characters
- Freewrite about the story
- Take a break and let subconscious work

**Phase 2: Discovery and Assessment**
- **Take a break** - get distance (weeks if possible)
- **Read through quickly** - overall impression
- **Note what works** - surprising moments, strong scenes
- **Identify problems** - plot holes, pacing issues
- **Find the real story** - what the book is actually about
- **Reverse outline** - document what you have

**Phase 3: Structural Revision**
- Cut scenes that don't serve the real story
- Add missing scenes for logic or pacing
- Reorder if chronology doesn't work
- Strengthen character arcs retroactively
- Ensure causality (because X, therefore Y)
- Fix plot holes and contradictions

### Discovery Strategies

**The "North Star" Method**:
- Keep one guiding element:
  - Ending image (know where you're heading)
  - Central theme (touchstone for decisions)
  - Character's deepest fear (drives everything)
  - Core conflict (shapes all scenes)
- Provides direction without rigidity

**The "Stepping Stones" Approach**:
- Know a few key moments:
  - Opening situation
  - 2-3 major turning points
  - General ending direction
- Let discovery connect them
- Provides checkpoints without rigid outline

**The "Follow the Fun" Philosophy**:
- Jump to scenes you're passionate about
- Skip boring parts initially
- Trust what energizes you
- Fill gaps later
- Natural enthusiasm shows in prose

### For Premise Development

With discovery writing:
- Start with **what excites you** most
- Don't force complete premise upfront
- Let premise **emerge through writing**
- Allow premise to **evolve** as you discover story
- **Reverse-engineer logline** after draft
- Trust that **coherence comes in revision**

### For Outline Development

With discovery writing:
- Create **outline AFTER first draft** (reverse outline)
- Use outline to **identify structural problems**
- Let outline guide **revision**, not initial writing
- May create **mini-outline for next few chapters** when stuck
- Structure **discovered, not prescribed**

### For Character Development

With discovery writing:
- Start with **character basics** (name, situation, voice)
- **Discover character through their choices** in scenes
- Let characters **surprise you** with their actions
- **Interview characters** when you need clarity
- Character arc **emerges organically**
- Deepen arc in **revision** once you see it

### Challenges and Solutions

**Getting Lost in Middle**:
- Return to character's core goal
- Ask: "What would make this worse?"
- Skip to a scene you know
- Create mini-outline for next 5 chapters

**Plot Holes/Inconsistencies**:
- Keep continuity notes as you write
- Mark "[FIX]" in draft and keep going
- Accept this is part of revision
- Create detailed reverse outline
- Timeline tracking document

**Too Many Revisions**:
- Do structural diagnosis early (after draft 1)
- Commit to a version of the story
- Set revision goals per draft
- Get feedback for perspective

### Discovery for Different Genres

**Literary Fiction** (Natural fit):
- Character exploration priority
- Theme over plot
- Voice discovery
- Organic structure

**Commercial Fiction** (Needs more structure):
- Start with strong premise
- Keep "Stepping Stones" in mind
- Revise to genre structure
- Tighten in subsequent drafts

**Mystery/Thriller** (Challenging):
- Know basic mystery (victim, killer, motive)
- Track clues carefully in notes
- May need significant revision for logic
- Plant foreshadowing in later drafts

**Fantasy/Sci-Fi** (World building challenges):
- Know core world rules upfront
- Track world facts as you write
- Revise for consistency
- Create world bible from draft

### Hybrid Approaches

**"Pantsing with Training Wheels"**:
- Know opening, midpoint, ending
- Discover everything in between
- Revise to strengthen structure

**"Write-Discover-Outline-Revise"**:
- Draft first chunk (25%)
- Reverse outline and plan next chunk
- Repeat through the book

### The Discovery Writer's Mindset

**Embrace**:
- "I'll figure it out"
- "This might not work, but it's interesting"
- "The characters know better than I do"
- "Revision is where I make it work"

**Avoid**:
- "I need to know everything first"
- "This has to be perfect in draft one"
- "I can't write until I fix this"
- "Real writers outline"

### Benefits of Discovery

1. **Fresh, authentic** storytelling - not over-planned
2. **Character authenticity** - true to themselves
3. **Surprising twists** - even to author
4. **Voice emerges naturally** - not forced
5. **Maintains excitement** - always discovering
6. **Avoids over-thinking** - paralysis by analysis

### Essential Tools

**During Drafting**:
- Notes document for tracking details
- Character sketches (evolving)
- Timeline (update as you go)
- "[FIX]" markers for later

**During Revision**:
- Reverse outline of what you wrote
- Beat sheet analysis for structure
- Character arc tracker
- Theme analysis
- Continuity checklist

### Key Success Principles

1. **Finish the draft** - resist urge to restart
2. **Keep notes** - track details as you go
3. **Trust the mess** - first draft is discovery
4. **Embrace revision** - where real work happens
5. **Stay flexible** - let characters surprise you
6. **Don't judge draft** - evaluation comes later
7. **Set daily word goals** - maintain momentum
