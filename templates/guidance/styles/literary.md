## Literary Style Guidance

When writing for **Literary Fiction**, focus on:

### Premise Development
- Emphasize **thematic questions** over high-concept hooks
- Center on **character psychology** as the primary driver
- Develop **subtle, nuanced conflict** (often internal)
- Explore **social/philosophical commentary**
- Create **character-driven stakes** rather than plot-driven ones

### Outline Approach
- Structure around **character arc** and internal journey
- Consider **non-linear narratives** if thematically justified
- Allow for **episodic or vignette-based** structures
- Map **thematic resonance** across chapters
- Traditional beats may be **subtle or subverted**
- Resolution may be **ambiguous or open-ended**

### Prose Style
- Use **precise, evocative** word choices
- Employ **varied sentence structures** for rhythm and emphasis
- Develop **lyrical or poetic** qualities when appropriate
- Master **show, don't tell** technique
- Include rich **sensory details** that evoke mood and meaning
- Layer **subtext** in dialogue and description
- Consider techniques like: stream of consciousness, unreliable narration, temporal shifts, metafictional elements

### Character Development
- Create **complex, contradictory** characters with **psychological depth**
- Develop **flawed protagonists** without easy redemption
- Embrace **ambiguous morality** and realistic human behavior
- Allow for subtle transformation, circular arcs, or tragic arcs

### Pacing
- **Slower, contemplative** pacing is acceptable
- **Digressive passages** for thematic exploration are valued
- Give **quiet moments** equal weight to dramatic ones
- Build tension through **psychology** not just external plot

### Dialogue
- Craft **realistic, naturalistic** dialogue with artful construction
- Employ heavy **subtext** - characters don't say what they mean
- Reveal **character psychology** and relationships through speech
- **Avoid exposition** - trust reader intelligence

### Themes
- Integrate through **recurring images and motifs**
- Use **symbolic objects or settings**
- Create **parallel plots** that echo themes
- Allow **ambiguity that invites interpretation**

### Reader Expectations
Literary readers expect:
- Intellectual and emotional engagement
- Beautiful or innovative prose
- Complex characters and relationships
- Thematic depth worth pondering
- Originality in voice or approach
- Tolerance for slower pacing, ambiguous endings, experimental structures
