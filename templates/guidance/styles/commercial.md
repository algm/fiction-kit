## Commercial Style Guidance

When writing for **Commercial Fiction**, focus on:

### Premise Development
- Create **high-concept hooks** that sell the story in one sentence
- Establish **clear, compelling conflict** from the start
- Define **universal stakes** readers can relate to
- Include **genre-appropriate elements**
- Craft a **marketable logline**

### Outline Approach
- Use proven structures: **Three-act** or **Save the Cat beat sheet**
- Ensure **clear escalation** of conflict and stakes
- Provide **satisfying payoffs** for all setup
- End chapters with **page-turning hooks**
- Hit major beats **clearly and strongly**:
  - Hook in first pages (inciting incident by 10-15%)
  - End of Act I around 25% (commitment)
  - Midpoint at 50% (game-changer)
  - All is Lost around 75%
  - Climax in final 10-15%

### Prose Style
- Write **clear, accessible** prose
- Favor **active voice**
- Use **varied but not complex** sentence structures
- Choose **strong verbs** and concrete nouns
- Minimize adverbs and adjectives
- Balance **fast-paced action** with earned contemplative moments

### Character Development
- Create **relatable, sympathetic** protagonists
- Define **clear wants and needs**
- Ensure characters are **active** (drive the plot through choices)
- Develop **distinct, memorable** supporting cast
- Show clear **transformation arc** by story's end

### Pacing
- Maintain momentum - **no sagging middle**
- Escalate stakes throughout
- Weave **multiple plot threads** for variety
- Use **ticking clocks** for urgency
- Apply **disaster-reaction-dilemma** cycles
- Vary scene and chapter length for rhythm

### Scene Construction
- Every scene has **clear goal and obstacle**
- Scenes **advance plot or deepen character** (ideally both)
- Use **strong scene openings and endings**
- **Cut late, leave early** (in medias res)
- End chapters on **cliffhangers or questions**

### Dialogue
- Write **snappy, purposeful** exchanges
- Reveal character efficiently
- Advance plot through information sharing
- Include subtext but keep it accessible
- Avoid "on the nose" exposition
- Create **distinct voices** per character

### Plot Structure
- Include essential elements:
  - Inciting incident disrupts status quo
  - Rising action with escalating complications
  - Midpoint shift changes everything
  - Dark night tests protagonist
  - Climax brings all threads together
  - Resolution satisfies and surprises
- Limit to **2-3 subplots** that support main plot or theme

### Reader Expectations
Commercial readers expect:
- Engaging story from page one
