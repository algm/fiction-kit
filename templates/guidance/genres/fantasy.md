## Fantasy Genre Guidance

When writing **Fantasy Fiction**, focus on:

### Essential Genre Elements
- **Magic system** with clear rules, limitations, and costs
- **Worldbuilding** that feels lived-in and coherent
- **Epic or personal stakes** (or both layered)
- **Sense of wonder** and discovery
- Hero's journey or chosen one tropes (or intentional subversion)

### Premise Development
- Common hooks: ordinary person discovers power, hidden magical world, quest to save world/kingdom, prophesied hero, political intrigue in fantasy setting
- Layer stakes: **Personal** (identity, freedom, loved ones), **Local** (village/kingdom), **Global** (entire world), **Cosmic** (balance of magic)

### Worldbuilding Critical Elements
1. **Magic System**: Define how magic works, who can use it, costs/consequences, cultural attitudes
2. **Geography**: Create map-worthy locations with varied terrain and strategic importance
3. **History**: Develop ancient conflicts, lost civilizations, prophecies and legends
4. **Cultures**: Distinct peoples with unique traits, political systems, religious beliefs, social hierarchies
5. **Economy**: Show how magic affects daily life, technology level, trade systems

### Worldbuilding Integration
- **Reveal through character experience**, not exposition
- **Use all senses** to make world tangible
- **Show cultural differences** through details
- **Make world affect plot** (not just backdrop)
- **Iceberg principle**: know 10x more than you show

### Character Archetypes (Use or Subvert)
- The Chosen One, The Mentor, The Warrior, The Thief/Rogue, The Mage, The Noble
- Modern variations: Flawed protagonists, morally grey characters, strong female warriors, found family, diverse representation

### Plot Structure Options
- **Classic Hero's Journey**: Call to adventure, refusal, threshold crossing, trials, ordeal, return
- **Modern variations**: Start in medias res, subvert chosen one, political intrigue focus, character-driven over plot-driven

### Magic System Approaches
- **Hard Magic** (Sanderson's Laws): Clear rules reader understands, limitations create tension, can solve climax problems
- **Soft Magic**: Mysterious and wondrous, unexplained, creates atmosphere, cannot solve main plot
- **Cost types**: Physical exhaustion, life force, mental strain, rare materials, time requirements, moral corruption

### Pacing Balance
- **Action/adventure** vs. **character development**
- **Worldbuilding** vs. **plot momentum**
- **Description** vs. **forward motion**
- Use travel montages when journey not crucial; keep training sequences brief unless plot-relevant

### Dialogue Considerations
- **Avoid faux-medieval "thee/thou"** unless culturally specific
- Balance **modern accessibility** with period flavor
- Show **cultural differences** in speech patterns
- Use magic terminology naturally
- Reflect **class distinctions** in language
- **Avoid infodumping** through dialogue

### Subgenre Expectations
- **High Fantasy (Epic)**: Secondary world, grand scale, good vs. evil, multiple POVs, series-oriented
- **Urban Fantasy**: Contemporary city, magic hidden, often first-person, mystery/thriller pacing
- **Dark/Grimdark**: Morally ambiguous, horror elements, anti-heroes, realistic violence
- **Sword and Sorcery**: Action-oriented, roguish protagonists, personal quests, exotic locales

### Common Tropes
- **Use Thoughtfully**: Prophecies, magic swords/artifacts, ancient evil, lost heir, dragon riders
- **Avoid or Subvert**: Perfect heroes, women as only love interests, monolithic "evil races", medieval Europe as only setting, info dump prologues, deus ex machina

### Reader Expectations
Fantasy readers expect:
- Immersive worldbuilding with sense of wonder
- Magic or supernatural elements integral to story
- Epic or meaningful stakes
- Character growth and transformation
- Good storytelling above all
- Consistent magic rules and world logic
- Fresh spins on familiar tropes
