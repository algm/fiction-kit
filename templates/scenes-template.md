## Drafting Strategy

### Sequential Approach (Recommended for first draft)
1. Draft Chapter 1 completely
2. Review for flow and hooks
3. Continue to Chapter 2
4. Maintain momentum over polish

### Scene-by-Scene Approach
1. Draft all [POV] scenes in sequence
2. Draft supporting scenes
3. Review transitions

### Key Scenes First
1. Draft all major beats (Inciting Incident, Midpoint, Climax)
2. Fill in connecting scenes
3. Add texture and depth

---

## Notes

- Each scene should have a clear purpose
- Scene endings should propel reader forward
- Balance scene types (not all action, not all dialogue)
- Track time passage between scenes
- Note any scenes that feel redundant or missable
- Mark scenes requiring research with [RESEARCH: topic]
