# Discovery Writing Best Practices (Pantsing)

## Overview

Discovery Writing (also called "pantsing" - writing by the seat of your pants) is an organic approach where the writer discovers the story as they write, rather than planning everything upfront.

**Core Philosophy**: Trust your creative instincts and let the story unfold naturally through the act of writing.

## Key Principles

### 1. Write First, Outline Later
- Begin with a premise or character and start writing
- Let the story reveal itself through drafting
- Outline retroactively if needed for revision
- Trust the subconscious to guide the narrative

### 2. Embrace the Unknown
- Don't know everything before you start
- Surprise yourself as a writer
- Allow characters to take unexpected directions
- Follow interesting tangents

### 3. Character-Driven Discovery
- Start with compelling characters
- Let character decisions drive plot
- Ask "What would they do?" in each situation
- Characters often know better than you

### 4. Iterative Drafting
- First draft is exploration
- Expect major revisions
- Rewrite more than planners
- Each draft clarifies the story

## What Discovery Writers Need to Know

### Minimum Starting Points

**Essential** (Pick 1-2):
- **Compelling character**: Who fascinates you
- **Intriguing situation**: Opening scene or premise
- **Powerful image**: Scene you can't stop thinking about
- **Thematic question**: What you want to explore
- **Emotional journey**: Feeling arc you want to create

**Optional** (Nice to Have):
- General sense of ending
- Key turning points or scenes
- Character backstory (may change)
- Setting or world basics
- Tone and voice

### What You Don't Need
- Complete outline
- Chapter plan
- Beat sheet
- Character arc mapped out
- Every plot twist planned
- Detailed world bible (for fantasy)

## The Discovery Writing Process

### Phase 1: The Messy First Draft
**Goal**: Get the story out of your head and onto the page

**Approach**:
- Write forward, don't look back
- Follow your instincts scene by scene
- Let "mistakes" happen (they may be gifts)
- Don't fix continuity yet
- Keep momentum - finish the draft
- Allow yourself to "write badly"

**When You Get Stuck**:
- Ask: "What would make this worse for the protagonist?"
- Jump to a scene you're excited about
- Interview your characters
- Freewrite about the story
- Take a break and let subconscious work

### Phase 2: Discovery and Assessment
**Goal**: Understand what you actually wrote

**Steps**:
1. **Take a break** - get distance (weeks if possible)
2. **Read through quickly** - overall impression
3. **Note what works** - surprising moments, strong scenes
4. **Identify problems** - plot holes, pacing issues
5. **Find the real story** - what the book is actually about
6. **Reverse outline** - document what you have
7. **Character arc analysis** - how they actually changed

**Questions to Ask**:
- What is this story really about?
- What surprised me?
- Where does it come alive?
- Where does it sag or confuse?
- Did characters stay consistent?
- Are there themes emerging?

### Phase 3: Structural Revision
**Goal**: Shape the discovered story into its best form

**Tasks**:
- Cut scenes that don't serve the real story
- Add missing scenes for logic or pacing
- Reorder scenes if chronology doesn't work
- Strengthen character arcs retroactively
- Ensure causality (because X, therefore Y)
- Fix plot holes and contradictions
- Sharpen theme

**Tools**:
- Create reverse outline from draft
- Use beat sheet to diagnose structure
- Character arc tracking document
- Timeline for continuity
- Thematic analysis

### Phase 4: Line-Level Revision
**Goal**: Polish prose and refine details

**Focus**:
- Strengthen scene-level writing
- Improve dialogue
- Enhance descriptions
- Tighten prose
- Ensure voice consistency
- Fix continuity errors

## Discovery Writing Strategies

### The "North Star" Method
**Keep One Guiding Element**:
- Ending image (know where you're heading)
- Central theme (touchstone for decisions)
- Character's deepest fear (drives everything)
- Core conflict (shapes all scenes)

**Benefits**:
- Provides direction without rigidity
- Allows discovery within boundaries
- Helps filter what to keep/cut

### The "Stepping Stones" Approach
**Know a Few Key Moments**:
- Opening situation
- 2-3 major turning points
- General ending direction
- Let discovery connect them

**Benefits**:
- More security than pure pantsing
- Still allows major surprises
- Provides checkpoints

### The "Character Interview" Method
**Before and During Writing**:
- Interview characters extensively
- Ask about backstory, fears, desires
- Let them surprise you with answers
- Trust what they tell you

**Benefits**:
- Deep character understanding
- Authentic character voice
- Characters drive plot naturally

### The "Follow the Fun" Philosophy
**Write What Excites You**:
- Jump to scenes you're passionate about
- Skip boring parts initially
- Trust what energizes you
- Fill gaps later

**Benefits**:
- Maintains writing momentum
- Best scenes written first
- Natural enthusiasm in prose

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Getting Lost in the Middle
**Symptoms**:
- Don't know what happens next
- Story feels aimless
- Multiple abandoned subplots

**Solutions**:
- Return to character's core goal
- Ask: "What would make this worse?"
- Skip to a scene you know
- Take a break and brainstorm
- Create mini-outline for next 5 chapters

### Challenge: Plot Holes and Inconsistencies
**Symptoms**:
- Characters contradict earlier behavior
- Timeline doesn't work
- Forgotten plot threads

**Solutions**:
- Keep continuity notes as you write
- Accept this is part of revision
- Mark "[FIX]" in draft and keep writing
- Create detailed reverse outline
- Timeline tracking document

### Challenge: Too Many Revisions
**Symptoms**:
- Fourth draft still has structural problems
- Story keeps changing fundamentally
- Never feels "done"

**Solutions**:
- Do structural diagnosis early (after draft 1)
- Commit to a version of the story
- Set revision goals per draft
- Get feedback to gain perspective
- Consider hybrid approach next time

### Challenge: Word Count Bloat
**Symptoms**:
- Draft is 150k words
- Too many subplots
- Meandering narrative

**Solutions**:
- Identify the core story
- Be ruthless in cutting
- Combine similar scenes
- Remove characters who don't earn their place
- Check: does this scene advance plot or deepen character?

## Hybrid Approaches (Discovery + Planning)

### "Pantsing with Training Wheels"
- Know opening, midpoint, ending
- Discover everything in between
- Revise to strengthen structure

### "Plan-Then-Discover"
- Do minimal planning (premise, characters, ending)
- Draft by discovery
- Let planning guide, not dictate

### "Write-Discover-Outline-Revise"
- Draft first chunk (25%)
- Reverse outline and plan next chunk
- Repeat through the book
- Combines discovery with course correction

## Famous Discovery Writers

**Examples**:
- **Stephen King**: "I write to find out what happens"
- **Margaret Atwood**: Discovers while writing
- **George R.R. Martin**: "Gardener" not "Architect"
- **Gillian Flynn**: Finds twists while drafting

## Benefits of Discovery Writing

1. **Fresh, authentic storytelling** - not over-planned
2. **Character authenticity** - true to themselves
3. **Surprising twists** - even to the author
4. **Voice emerges naturally** - not forced
5. **Maintains writing excitement** - always discovering
6. **Avoids over-thinking** - paralysis by analysis
7. **Organic theme integration** - not heavy-handed

## Drawbacks to Prepare For

1. **More extensive revision** required
2. **Possible dead ends** and wasted scenes
3. **Plot holes** to fix later
4. **Inconsistent characterization** to smooth
5. **Longer process** overall (draft + major revisions)
6. **Can be inefficient** - throw away work
7. **Requires trust** in the process

## When Discovery Writing Works Best

### Ideal For:
- Experienced writers who revise well
- Character-driven stories
- Literary fiction
- Writers who plan too much and lose passion
- Stories driven by voice or theme
- Exploratory projects

### Less Ideal For:
- First novel (can be overwhelming)
- Complex plots (mystery, thriller)

- Stories requiring intricate setup/payoff

## Tips for Successful Discovery Writing

1. **Finish the draft** - resist urge to restart
2. **Keep notes** - track details as you go
3. **Trust the mess** - first draft is discovery
4. **Embrace revision** - where the real work happens
5. **Learn your patterns** - what you discover each time
6. **Stay flexible** - let characters surprise you
7. **Read widely** - unconsciously absorb structure
8. **Set daily word goals** - maintain momentum
9. **Don't judge the draft** - save evaluation for later
10. **Celebrate discovery** - the joy of the process

## Essential Tools for Discovery Writers

### During Drafting:
- **Writing software** with search function
- **Notes document** for tracking details
- **Character sketches** (evolving)
- **Timeline** (update as you go)
- **"[FIX]" markers** for later attention

### During Revision:
- **Reverse outline** of what you wrote
- **Beat sheet analysis** for structure
- **Character arc tracker**
- **Theme analysis document**
- **Continuity checklist**

## The Discovery Writer's Mindset

### Embrace:
- "I'll figure it out"
- "This might not work, but it's interesting"
- "The characters know better than I do"
- "I'm discovering the story, not creating it"
- "Revision is where I make it work"

### Avoid:
- "I need to know everything first"
- "This has to be perfect in draft one"
- "I can't write the next scene until I fix this"
- "Real writers outline"
- "If it's hard, I'm doing it wrong"

## Making It Work

**The Key**: Trust the process, embrace revision, and remember that many successful authors write this way. The messy first draft is not a failure - it's the discovery that reveals your story.
