# Literary Fiction Best Practices

## Core Characteristics

Literary fiction prioritizes:
- **Prose quality and craft** over plot mechanics
- **Thematic depth** and exploration of human nature
- **Character interiority** and psychological complexity
- **Symbolic and metaphorical language**
- **Experimental or innovative techniques**
- **Ambiguity and complexity** over easy answers

## Premise Development (Literary)

### Focus Areas
- **Thematic questions** over high-concept hooks
- **Character psychology** as central driver
- **Social/philosophical commentary**
- **Subtle, nuanced conflict** (often internal)
- **Character-driven stakes** rather than plot-driven

### Example Themes
- The nature of identity and self-deception
- Isolation and connection in modern life
- Memory, loss, and the passage of time
- Class, privilege, and social structures
- The artist's relationship to their work

## Outline Structure (Literary)

### Preferred Approaches
- **Character arc-focused** structure
- **Non-linear narratives** when thematically justified
- **Episodic or vignette-based** structures
- **Internal journey** mapped alongside external events
- **Thematic resonance** across chapters

### Beat Sheet Adaptations
- Traditional beats may be **subtle or subverted**
- Midpoint may be an **internal realization** not external event
- "All is Lost" focuses on **psychological despair**
- Climax is **character insight**, not action
- Resolution may be **ambiguous or open-ended**

## Prose Style (Literary)

### Language Characteristics
- **Precise, evocative** word choices
- **Varied sentence structures** for rhythm and emphasis
- **Lyrical or poetic** qualities when appropriate
- **Show, don't tell** taken to high art
- **Sensory details** that evoke mood and meaning
- **Subtext** in dialogue and description

### Techniques to Embrace
- Stream of consciousness
- Deep POV with close psychic distance
- Unreliable narration
- Temporal shifts (flashbacks, flash-forwards)
- Metafictional elements
- Rich internal monologue

### Things to Avoid
- Clichéd or generic descriptions
- Obvious plot mechanics
- Heavy-handed theme statements
- Simplistic character motivations
- Predictable story arcs
- Genre tropes used unironically

## Character Development (Literary)

### Focus
- **Complex, contradictory** characters
- **Psychological depth** over clear wants/needs
- **Flawed protagonists** without easy redemption
- **Ambiguous morality**
- **Realistic human behavior** (messy, inconsistent)

### Arc Patterns
- Subtle transformation or no transformation
- Circular arcs (returning to beginning changed)
- Tragic arcs (decline or failure)
- Ambiguous outcomes (growth unclear)

## Pacing and Structure (Literary)

### Pacing
- **Slower, contemplative** pacing acceptable
- **Digressive passages** for thematic exploration
- **Quiet moments** given equal weight to dramatic ones
- **Building tension through psychology** not just plot

### Scene Construction
- Scenes may prioritize **mood and insight** over action
- **Description and reflection** integrated seamlessly
- **Endings can be subtle** - no need for cliffhangers
- **White space** used for reader contemplation

## Dialogue (Literary)

### Characteristics
- **Realistic, naturalistic** (with artful construction)
- **Subtext-heavy** - characters don't say what they mean
- **Reveals character psychology** and relationships
- **May include dialect or idiolect** for authenticity
- **Avoids exposition** - trusts reader intelligence

## World-Building (Literary)

### Approach
- **Integrated naturally** into character experience
- **Setting as metaphor** or thematic resonance
- **Sensory and emotional** rather than technical
- **Cultural and social details** that illuminate themes
- **Minimal infodumping** - trust reader to infer

## Thematic Integration (Literary)

### Methods
- **Recurring images and motifs**
- **Symbolic objects or settings**
- **Parallel plots or storylines**
- **Character relationships as thematic mirrors**
- **Structural choices reflecting theme**
- **Ambiguity that invites interpretation**

## Reader Expectations (Literary)

### What Literary Readers Expect
- **Intellectual and emotional engagement**
- **Beautiful or innovative prose**
- **Complex characters and relationships**
- **Thematic depth worth pondering**
- **Originality in voice or approach**
- **Artistic ambition**

### What They're Willing to Accept
- Slower pacing
- Ambiguous or unhappy endings
- Experimental structures
- Challenging subject matter
- Lack of genre conventions

### What Will Disappoint Them
- Predictable plotting
- Simplistic themes or messages
- Flat prose
- Genre clichés used without irony
- Neat, unrealistic resolutions
