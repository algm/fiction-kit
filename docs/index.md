# Fiction Kit

*Your AI-Powered Creative Writing Companion*

**A comprehensive toolkit for AI-assisted fiction writing. Define your story's foundations, develop characters and worlds, outline your plot, and draft prose—all with structured workflows that maintain consistency and creative control.**

## What is Fiction Kit?

Fiction Kit applies **structured development methodology** to creative writing. Instead of vibe-writing every scene from scratch, Fiction Kit helps you:

- **Define story foundations** with clear premise, theme, and conflict
- **Develop rich characters** with wounds, lies, and arcs
- **Build consistent worlds** with rules and history
- **Plan structured outlines** using proven methodologies
- **Draft prose** that maintains voice and style consistency

## Core Philosophy

Fiction Kit emphasizes:

- **Intent-driven development** where story foundations define the "*what*" before the "*how*"
- **Rich story creation** using guardrails and writing principles
- **Multi-step refinement** rather than one-shot prose generation from prompts
- **Heavy reliance** on advanced AI capabilities for creative collaboration
